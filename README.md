# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')

This repository contains a bug report and solution for the common React Native error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`.

## Bug Description

The error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` typically occurs when you attempt to use the `.map()` method on an array or object that is currently undefined or null. This often happens when data hasn't yet been fetched, or when there's a problem in the data flow within your React Native application.

## Bug Reproduction

The `bug.js` file demonstrates the code that produces this error. You'll need to have a React Native environment set up to run it.

## Solution

The solution involves checking for the existence of the data before attempting to use the `.map()` method.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with appropriate conditional rendering.

This solution ensures that the `.map()` method is only called when the data is available, thus preventing the error.

## Additional Notes

This error can be tricky.  Ensure that asynchronous operations (such as data fetching) are handled correctly with state updates, preventing accessing data before it's ready.
