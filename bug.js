This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This is a common error in JavaScript, but it can be especially tricky to debug in React Native because the error messages are not always very clear. The most common cause of this error is trying to access a property of a component's state or props before the component has mounted. For example, if you have a component that renders a list of items, you might try to access the items property of the state before the component has fetched the data. In this case, the items property will be undefined, and you will get a TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map').
